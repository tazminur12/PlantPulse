        question: "How often should I water my plants?",
        answer: "Watering frequency depends on the plant type, pot size, and environment. Most houseplants need watering when the top 1-2 inches of soil feels dry. Succulents prefer drying out completely between waterings.",
        additionalInfo: "Use the finger test: Stick your finger in the soil up to the second knuckle. If it feels dry, it's time to water."
      },
      {
        question: "Why are my plant's leaves turning yellow?",
        answer: "Yellow leaves can indicate overwatering, underwatering, nutrient deficiency, or natural aging. Check your watering habits first - overwatering is the most common cause.",
        additionalInfo: "Bottom leaves yellowing naturally is often just the plant shedding old growth."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the best location for my plant?",
        answer: "Most houseplants thrive in bright, indirect light near east or west-facing windows. Low-light plants like snake plants can tolerate north-facing windows or interior spaces.",
        additionalInfo: "Rotate your plant 90Â° weekly to ensure even growth towards the light."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know if my plant needs repotting?",
        answer: "Signs include roots growing through drainage holes, water running straight through, slowed growth, or the plant becoming top-heavy. Most plants need repotting every 12-18 months.",
        additionalInfo: "Spring is the best time to repot as plants enter their active growth phase."
      },
      {
        question: "How can I increase humidity for tropical plants?",
        answer: "Group plants together, use a pebble tray with water, mist leaves in the morning, or use a humidifier. Bathrooms often have naturally higher humidity.",
        additionalInfo: "Avoid misting plants with fuzzy leaves like African violets as it can cause spotting."
